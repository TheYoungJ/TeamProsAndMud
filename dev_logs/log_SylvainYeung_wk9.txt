Fixed the bug with the music player, the player was not calling the stop() function when the activity exited
so the music continued to play. 
Implemented an on-click listener for the list views containing the song names. This listener function redirects
the user to a 2nd activity which is the music player.
The music payer contains a seekbar and buttons to control the playback of the song.
Linked the seekbar with the music player object, so the position of the cursor controls the 
time of the song. Usable to seek to specific timepoints within the file.
Implemented on-click functions for the buttons to play/pause the song and to skip forwards/backwards 5 seconds.
