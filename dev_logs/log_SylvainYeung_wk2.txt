Researched feasibility of a few different app ideas.
Looked at a potential "work-out" app, designed to give the user a specific daily workout routine.
    -would be useful during COVID lockdown
Looked at a media streaming app, designed to consolidate media streaming from other applications/ sources
    -originally two ideas (a video app + a music app), we decided to combine the ideas together
Met together as a group to discuss our ideas further and potential implementations of cerain features.
Total time spent: 4h
