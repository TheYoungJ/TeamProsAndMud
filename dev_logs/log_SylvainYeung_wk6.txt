Implemented a multi-activity function within the app.
This function creates a second "window" with its own UI elements and methods that are attached to it.
Created an "Intent" which is an object that used to control the flow of the application.
The Intent object redirects the user to the second window and back to the first when the user exits the second window
via the back button.
Implemented a "bundle" object which is used to store data and pass it to the second window via the Intent object.
