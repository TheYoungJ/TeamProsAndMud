    -Resolved: Error was caused due to none declared 2nd activity within the manifest XML file
Had to edit the manifest file to allow the app to access the devices's storage.
    -permission change for the app
Created a function to opened files and accesed them within the application.
Implemented a list view that is composed of dynamically generated separate elements that will be used as a tile for a "song"
