Finish implementing the list view. The "list" elements within the view are generated based on how many music files that
the application has found within the device. The content of list view are the Song Names - Artist/Band.
Put together the multiple-activity functionality with the list view to create a dynamically generated interface which will lead
to the music player.
Implemented an other activity/window for the music player interface, with a seekbar and buttons which will be used to control the music stream.
Test a music streaming function, the application can successfully play a song, however the choice of the song is hard coded in. Will implement a way for
the user to choose a song.
BUG: the song continues to play even when the user leaves the music player window
